Getting insights from an application component about its operations, timing and relation to application code is crucial to understand latency.
Lettuce ships with a Micrometer integration to collect observations during Redis interaction.
Once the integration is set up, Micrometer will create meters and spans (for distributed tracing) for each Redis command.

To enable the integration, apply the following configuration to `LettuceClientConfiguration`:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
class ObservabilityConfiguration {

  @Bean
  public ClientResources clientResources(ObservationRegistry observationRegistry) {

    return ClientResources.builder()
              .tracing(new MicrometerTracing(observationRegistry, "my-redis-cache"))
              .build();
  }

  @Bean
  public LettuceConnectionFactory lettuceConnectionFactory(ClientResources clientResources) {

    LettuceClientConfiguration clientConfig = LettuceClientConfiguration.builder()
                                                .clientResources(clientResources).build();
    RedisConfiguration redisConfiguration = â€¦;
    return new LettuceConnectionFactory(redisConfiguration, clientConfig);
  }
}
